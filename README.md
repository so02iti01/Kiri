# Kiri

> Painless mind-maps and diagrams

Beta warning: This is still a work in progress. If you intend to add data to Kiri that you do not wish to lose, take occasional screenshots or save the value of `nodes` in `localStorage`

## Features

- Easy-to-use interface for both mind-maps and diagrams of many types
- Every thing is done locally and saved in `localStorage` (AKA there's no back-end)
